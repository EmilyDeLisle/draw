# Draw

Draw is an Object-Oriented Programming final project I did in term 2 of the Computer Systems Technology program at BCIT. The goal was to demonstrate all of the principles of OOP practiced throughout the term and create a fully-funtional drawing application using Java and JavaFX. 
    
The program lets the user draw several different shapes, including a freeform polygon shape, in the colour of their choice. The user can also move and delete any shape they have drawn. The application manages a stack of shapes to correctly layer them on top of one another, but also allows the user to click on and move or delete specific shapes.

For demonstrations and images of the application in action, please visit my portfolio at [emilydelisle.ca](https://emilydelisle.ca).
